                Welcome to the PLP Web Development Week 1 Assignment. This project is designed to introduce foundational concepts of modern web development, focusing on the use of semantic HTML5 elements, accessibility best practices, and strategies for creating SEO-friendly web pages.
            </p>
            <p>
               The index.html file is the essential starting point for any website, impacting usability, accessibility, and search engine visibility. Modern web development emphasizes creating pages that are semantically meaningful, accessible to all users, and optimized for SEO. Using HTML5 semantic elements like <header>, <nav>, and <main> provides clear structure, helping both users and search engines understand the content. 
            </p>
            <p>
                A logical heading hierarchy improves navigation and SEO, while accessibility features such as proper labels and alt text ensure inclusivity. Finally, SEO-friendly metadata in the <head> section boosts discoverability.
            </p>
            <p>
                Together, these practices make index.html not just functional but foundational to an effective, user-friendly website.
